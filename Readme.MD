## Module 3 Final Project - Terry Stop Arrest Prediction

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to leverage a database containing detailed information on Terry Stops conducted by the Seattle police officers. The objective is to perform a classification analysis to predict whether an arrest is likely to occur following a Terry Stop. This predictive capability can serve as a valuable tool for police officers, enabling them to better prepare for potential outcomes during a stop based on specific variables present at the time of the stop. Such insights can enhance officer safety, improve decision-making, and foster more effective policing strategies.

### Data Science Process Used
For this project, I adhered to the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) data science process. This methodology provides a structured approach to tackling data-driven projects and ensures comprehensive analysis and interpretation of results. The notebook accompanying this project is meticulously organized to reflect each stage of the OSEMN process, ensuring clarity and replicability of the analysis.

### The Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project encompasses a wealth of information on every Terry Stop conducted by Seattle police officers. Key attributes include:

- **Weapon Type**: The type of weapon, if any, that was involved in the stop.
- **Arrest Made**: A binary variable indicating whether an arrest was made as a result of the stop.
- **Reported Date**: The date on which the Terry Stop was reported.
- **Officer Precinct**: The precinct of the officer conducting the stop.
- **Additional Variables**: Other relevant variables that may influence the outcome of the stop.

A Terry Stop, based on 'reasonable suspicion,' allows officers to temporarily detain a person suspected of being involved in criminal activity. The rich detail provided in the dataset enables a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding the factors that influence the likelihood of an arrest during these stops.

### Key Questions Investigated
1. **Predicting Arrest Likelihood**: The central question of this analysis is to predict whether an arrest is likely to occur as a result of a Terry Stop. By developing a robust classification model, we aim to identify the probability of an arrest based on various features present during the stop.

2. **Identifying Important Features**: Another critical aspect of this project is to determine which features are most significant in predicting the likelihood of an arrest. Understanding these features can provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to different outcomes during Terry Stops.

3. **Improving Police Officer Preparedness**: Ultimately, this research aims to improve police officer preparedness for Terry Stops. By providing predictive insights and highlighting important features, officers can be better equipped to anticipate potential outcomes and adjust their approach accordingly, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and safety during stops.

### Detailed Analysis and Findings

#### Data Acquisition and Cleaning (Obtain and Scrub)
The first steps involved acquiring the dataset and performing data cleaning to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. This included handling missing values, correcting any inconsistencies, and transforming variables into formats suitable for analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (Explore)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain an initial understanding of the data. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying any patterns or anomalies in the data. Key insights from EDA informed the feature selection and model-building process.

#### Model Building (Model)
Various classification algorithms were employed to build predictive models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance.

#### Interpretation of Results (Interpret)
The final stage involved interpreting the results of the model to derive meaningful insights. Feature importance analysis was performed to identify which variables had the most significant impact on the likelihood of an arrest. Additionally, the implications of these findings for police practices and policies were discussed.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to a real-world problem with significant societal implications. By predicting the likelihood of an arrest during a Terry Stop and identifying key influencing factors, this research provides valuable insights that can enhance police officer preparedness and contribute to more effective and informed policing strategies. The structured approach following the OSEMN process ensures a thorough and replicable analysis, paving the way for future research and applications in this area.

### Future Work
Future work could expand on this project by incorporating additional data sources, such as demographic information or historical crime data, to further refine the predictive model. Moreover, collaboration with law enforcement agencies could provide practical insights and facilitate the implementation of these predictive tools in real-world policing scenarios.
